# Assignment 1
The provided code defines a class called ArrayOperations that performs various operations on a two-dimensional array of integers (dataArray). Here's a brief explanation of each member's function:
readFromFile: This function reads integer values from a file and populates the dataArray with the values. The filename is passed as a parameter.
checkInteger: This function searches for a specific integer within the dataArray and returns the index (position) of the integer if found. If the integer is not found, it returns -1.
modifyInteger: This function modifies the value at a specific index in the dataArray and returns a pair containing the old and new values. It takes the index and the new value as parameters.
addInteger: This function adds a new integer to the dataArray as a separate line.
replaceInteger: This function replaces the value at a specific index in the dataArray with a new value. It takes the index and the new value as parameters.
removeInteger: This function removes the value at a specific index from the dataArray. If the row becomes empty after removal, it is also removed. It takes the index as a parameter.
To use this code, follow these steps:
Include the necessary header file "arrayOperations.h".
Create an instance of the ArrayOperations class.
Call the member functions on the created instance to perform operations on the dataArray.
Replace "data.txt" with the actual filename you want to read from in the readFromFile function.
